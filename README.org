* Building

** Windows

Building for Windows via MinGW on Linux requires libusb static library and
header to be present under libusb/ in the source tree. Given the libusb 1.0.19
Windows binary distribution (libusb-1.0.19.7z), which looks like this...

    include/libusb-1.0/libusb.h
    MinGW32/static/libusb-1.0.a
    [other things we don't care about]

...the libusb/ directory here must look like this:

    libusb.h
    libusb-1.0.a
