Usage: antumbratool [-h] [-d <devicenum>] [-v] [-q] <command> ...

Options:

  -h|--help
    Print this message.

  -d|--device <devicenum>
    Perform operation on this device (default first found).

  -v|--verbose
    Increase debug level. In ascending order of verbosity, levels are: none,
    error, warning (default), info, debug. Specify this option multiple times to
    increase by that many levels. Specify -q -v to select errors only. Messages
    are logged to stderr. See also -q.

  -q|--quiet
    Suppress all debug messages (i.e. reset debug level to none). See also -v.

Commands:

  list
    List available devices.

  flash-read [outfile]
    Dump flash contents as raw binary. Output goes to outfile if specified,
    otherwise to standard output.

  flash-write [infile]
    Write raw binary to flash. Input is from infile if specified, otherwise
    from standard input.

  eeprom-read [outfile]
    Dump EEPROM contents as raw binary. Output goes to outfile if specified,
    otherwise to standard output.

  eeprom-write [infile]
    Write raw binary to EEPROM. Input is from infile if specified, otherwise
    from standard input.

  boot-set main|loader
    Persistently set device boot target. If 'loader', device will enter
    bootloader at power on. If 'main', device will enter main application.
    Hardware overrides (e.g. button or shortable PCB pads) may take precedence
    over this setting.

  reset
    Perform a hard reset.

  light-set <r> <g> <b>
    Set light color. <r> <g> <b> are integer constants (decimal, hexadecimal, or
    octal) in the range 0-65535 inclusive.

  raw [<hexdata> ...]
    Send raw packet data and print response. <hexdata> are 0 or more hexadecimal
    strings whose concatenation represents the 64-byte packet to send. If fewer
    than 64 bytes are represented, the packet is zero-padded. If an odd number
    of hex digits are provided, the trailing digit is ignored. The response
    packet is printed in like format.

  temp-readraw
    Read raw (uncalibrated) value from onboard temperature sensor.

  temp-readtemp
    Read calibrated temperature from onboard sensor.

  temp-readcal
    Read onboard temperature sensor calibration data.

  temp-writecal <a_sensor> <a_temp> <b_sensor> <b_temp>
    Write onboard temperature sensor calibration data.

    a_sensor: raw sensor value at calibration point A
    a_temp: temperature (mK) at calibration point A
    b_sensor: raw sensor value at calibration point B
    b_temp: temperature (mK) at calibration point B
